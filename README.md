# My Personal Portfolio Website

This is the codebase for my personal developer portfolio website:  
**[shobhit-portfolio.vercel.app](https://shobhit-portfolio.vercel.app/)**

---

## About Me

I’m **Shobhit Bansal**, an iOS Developer with 1 year of real-world experience using **Swift**, **UIKit**, **MVVM**, **BLE**, **CoreData**, and more.  
While my primary focus is mobile app development, I wanted to create a professional portfolio website to showcase my work and growth.

---

##  Tech Stack Used

- **React** (CRA-based single-page app)
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Deployed using Vercel**
- **Version control via GitHub**

## How I Built This (as an iOS Dev)

Honestly, I had **no prior experience with web development**, but I challenged myself to build this portfolio from scratch. Here's how I approached it:

1. **Used ChatGPT** to generate starter code in React + Tailwind.
2. **Used Vercel** for free and easy deployment of the site.
3. Iteratively added feature tweaks (like animations, icons, background images, etc.) and **learned by doing**.
4. Finalized the layout, design, and responsiveness based on real-time feedback and experimentation.
